## SECTION 3: PHASE 2 — CAMPUS CONQUEST (90 min)

### Admin Actions
1. **Control tab** → **"Advance to Phase 2"** — battery drain starts AUTOMATICALLY
2. Monitor from **Zones tab** and **Teams tab**
3. Battery overrides: go to Teams tab → set battery value → click Set
4. Zone resets if technical issue: Zones tab → Reset button

### Zone Operator Actions (one per zone)
Their laptop shows a zone operator screen. Flow:

**Neutral zone (first capture):**
1. Team arrives → operator enters their 4-digit passcode
2. System deducts **5% battery** from that team automatically
3. Operator sees **5 problem options** → picks one (make it interesting!)
4. Team reads the problem on the laptop screen
5. Operator **steps aside** — team types their answer themselves
6. Team clicks Submit
7. Correct → Zone captured (+20% battery to team), operator sees success screen
8. Wrong → Zone still neutral, operator sees fail screen

**Captured zone (re-capture attempt):**
1. Zone already has an owner (defending team)
2. Defending team already set a challenge from their dashboard
3. Attacker team arrives → passcode → 5% deducted
4. Challenge auto-loads (no operator selection needed)
5. Attacker types answer → submit
6. Correct → zone taken, attacker gets +20%, previous owner loses zone
7. Wrong → zone stays with defender

**Important rules for Zone Operators:**
- Only ONE team at a time — if another team is there, make them wait
- The zone screen shows "ZONE BUSY" automatically when an attempt is active
- DO NOT help teams — you are neutral
- If a team's answer is borderline (e.g. slightly different wording), use your judgment — check with admin
- If there's a dispute, immediately call admin on WhatsApp

### What Teams See
- Team dashboard shows battery level draining live
- At 20% battery: warning toast
- At 10% battery: urgent warning
- At 0%: eliminated, battery depleted screen
- When they capture a zone: +20% battery, prompt to set defense problem
- After capturing: team must go to dashboard → "Set Defense Problem" to trap other teams

### Battery Rules
- Starts at 100%
- Drains 2% per minute automatically
- -5% to ATTEMPT any zone (non-refundable if wrong)
- +20% on SUCCESSFUL capture (one-time per zone)
- If battery hits 0% → eliminated

### Advancement to Phase 3
- When 90 minutes is up (or admin decides to end early)
- Top 4–5 teams by zones captured advance
- Tiebreaker: higher battery %
- Admin manually clicks "Advance to Phase 3"

   - Option B: Different problems → select a team from dropdown → assign → repeat for each
3. Timer starts automatically (2.5 hours)
4. Monitor submissions in Phase 3 tab
